This is my final project for the Android module in my 12 month training as a native mobile app developer in Kotlin and SwiftUI.

I wanted to develop an app that enables communication within a company. The main target group are companies that have a lot of employees who are not in the office and are on the road all day, such as courier services.

Many of these employees can only use mobile devices during working hours

## **Example Personas:**

I have 2 personas here as examples:

**Carol Williams:**

She is a new employee in the company's journey planning department. Since she is new, she knows almost none of her colleagues, especially no drivers.


**Frank Miller:**

![m7 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c475d79-b202-4123-9766-32c52fe961ed)



He is a longtime driver and is on the road all day, so he is rarely in the office. Frank's last vacation was a long time ago, so he would like to easily submit vacation for the upcoming holidays
